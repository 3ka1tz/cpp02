# CPP Module 02
Ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overloading and the [Orthodox Canonical class form](https://riceset.com/C++/The-Orthodox-Canonical-Class-Form).

## [Exercise 00: My First Class in Orthodox Canonical Form](https://github.com/3ka1tz/cpp02/tree/main/project/ex00)
Create a class in Orthodox Canonical Form that represents a fixed-point number:
• Private members:
◦ An integer to store the fixed-point number value.
◦ A static constant integer to store the number of fractional bits. Its value will always be the integer literal 8.
• Public members:
◦ A default constructor that initializes the fixed-point number value to 0.
◦ A copy constructor.
◦ A copy assignment operator overload.
◦ A destructor.
◦ A member function int getRawBits( void ) const;
that returns the raw value of the fixed-point value.
◦ A member function void setRawBits( int const raw );
that sets the raw value of the fixed-point number.
